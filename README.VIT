# Chest X-ray Disease Classification using CNN, Vision Transformer & Swin Transformer
This project presents a deep learning pipeline for multi-class classification of chest X-ray images to identify congenital heart diseases such as ASD, VSD, PDA, and Normal conditions. The model combines CNNs (like ResNet50, InceptionV3), a custom Vision Transformer (ViT), and a lightweight Swin Transformer to improve classification accuracy and robustness.
